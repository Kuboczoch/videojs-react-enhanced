/*
 * # Process `plugins` array
 *
 * Plugins already registered on videojs object only need to pass options to `Videojs Player constructor`.
 * On the other hand, plugins not registered yet have to be registered manually with its options.
 *
 * As an input, function will get a `plugins` array which contains plugin objects passed through React `props`, following `Player.IVideoJsPlugin` interface.
 * - For the former case, `autoPlugins` object will be created, which contains each plugins' options that is used when player instance is created.
 *   - Each key's name maps to a plugin's name, and its value has an option for that plugin.
 *   - If there is no plugins that were previously generated, then `autoPlugins` object will be `undefined`, so that it can be ignored when creating player instance.
 * - For the latter case, `manualPlugins` array will be created, in which plugins need to be manually registered and initialize their option afterwards.
